    ### Task requirements:
    </summary>
  - Control each color of the RGB LED using 3 potentiometers that are hooked up to an Arduino, which will map the read values to the LED pins.

  ### Components needed:
  1. Arduino Uno
  2. 3 potentiometers
  3. 1 RGB LED
  4. A couple resistors (for current limiting)
  5. Wires (for connecting everything)

  ### Photos of the setup (including design schematic)
  
  Initially, I created the following schematic in KiCad so I could easily assemble the final circuit:
